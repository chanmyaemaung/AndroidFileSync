## Installation

### Download (Recommended)

1. Go to [**Releases**](https://github.com/Santosh7017/AndroidFileSync/releases) and download the latest `.dmg` file
2. Open the DMG and drag **AndroidFileSync** into your **Applications** folder
3. Open **Terminal** (search for it in Spotlight) and paste this command:

   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/AndroidFileSync.app
   ```

4. Launch the app — you're ready to go!

> **Why step 3?** macOS blocks apps that aren't from the App Store by default. This command tells your Mac it's safe to open. The app is fully open source — you can inspect every line of code yourself.

### Build from Source (For Developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Santosh7017/AndroidFileSync.git
cd AndroidFileSync
open AndroidFileSync.xcodeproj
```

Press ⌘R in Xcode to build and run. To create a DMG: `./build-dmg.sh`

## Setting Up Your Android Phone (One-Time)

Before the app can talk to your phone, you need to enable a hidden developer setting. This only takes a minute and you only have to do it once.

> **These first two steps are required for both USB and WiFi connections.**

### Step 1: Unlock Developer Options

1. Open **Settings** on your Android phone
2. Scroll down and tap **About Phone**
3. Find **Build Number** and tap it **7 times** quickly
4. You'll see a message: *"You are now a developer!"*

> **Samsung phones:** Go to **Settings → About Phone → Software Information → Build Number**

### Step 2: Turn On USB Debugging

1. Go back to **Settings**
2. Search and Tap **Developer Options** 
3. Find **USB Debugging** and turn it **ON**
4. Tap **OK** when it asks you to confirm

Now choose your connection method below:

---

### 🔌 Option A: USB Connection (Wired)

The simplest way to connect. Just plug in a cable.

1. Connect your phone to your Mac with a USB cable
2. On your phone, you'll see a prompt: **"Allow USB debugging?"**
3. Check **"Always allow from this computer"**
4. Tap **Allow**
5. Pull down the notification shade and tap the USB notification
6. Select **File Transfer / MTP**
7. Launch AndroidFileSync on your Mac — your phone will appear automatically

> **Tip:** If you don't see the "Allow USB debugging?" prompt, try unplugging and replugging the cable, or use a different USB port on your Mac.

---

### 📶 Option B: WiFi Connection (Wireless)

No cable needed. Your phone and Mac must be on the **same WiFi network**. Requires **Android 11** or later.

#### Extra Setup: Turn On Wireless Debugging

1. On your phone: go to **Settings → Developer Options**
2. Find **Wireless Debugging** and turn it **ON**
3. Tap on **Wireless Debugging** to open its settings

#### Auto-Discovery Pairing (Easiest)

1. Inside the Wireless Debugging settings, tap **Pair device with pairing code**
2. In the Mac app: click the **WiFi** button — the **Auto-Discovery** tab will automatically detect your phone and pre-fill the connection details
3. Type the **6-digit code** shown on your phone and click **Pair & Connect**

> **Got multiple phones?** A dropdown will appear letting you pick which device to connect to.

#### Advanced Pairing (Manual)

If Auto-Discovery doesn't find your phone (for example, on a corporate network or VPN):

1. Inside the Wireless Debugging settings, tap **Pair device with pairing code** — note the IP address, port, and code shown
2. In the Mac app: click the **WiFi** button → **Advanced** tab → type in the IP, port, and code manually

## How to Use

> A connection badge appears at the top: **blue** for USB, **green** for WiFi.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to Do |
|---------|------------|
| "Scanning for Device..." won't stop | Make sure USB Debugging is enabled and you tapped "Allow" on your phone |
| Phone not showing up | Try a different USB cable — some cables only charge and can't transfer data |
| WiFi pairing fails | Make sure both your Mac and phone are on the same WiFi network |
| Pairing code not working | Go back to Wireless Debugging on your phone and tap "Pair device" again to get a fresh code |
| Transfers are slow | Use a USB 3.0 cable and plug into a USB 3.0 port on your Mac |
| Trash won't empty | Disconnect and reconnect your device, then try again |
| App won't launch | Make sure you're on macOS 13.0 or newer, and that you ran the `xattr` command from step 3 |
